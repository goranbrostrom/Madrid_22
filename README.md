# Paper for presentation in Madrid, March 2022

Added sex and temp, birth month.

Tables are made shorter, some text updated (Feb 9 at 17:05).

The worst errors are removed (9 February at 00:18), but some may be
around. And text i missing. NOTE: Cache (global) introduced.

Now Bourgeois-Pichat and the log-cube transform are erased, but the
present state of *paper4.pdf* chaotic. No text is updated, only some
text is removed.

The file *paper3.pdf* is the old result of the project. Note the time
stamp on the front page, this report is *not* updated for some time.
